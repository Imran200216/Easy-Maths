    <h1>Privacy Policy for Easy Maths</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 17/10/2023</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Easy Maths (referred to as "we," "our," or "us"). We are
      committed to protecting the privacy of children under the age of 13 who
      use our Easy Maths and their parents or legal guardians. This Privacy
      Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal information in
      compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and
      other applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      2.1. Personal Information: We may collect the following personal
      information from children under the age of 13:

      Child's Name: Only if provided with parental consent. Parent or Guardian's
      Email Address: To obtain parental consent or respond to inquiries.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.2. Non-Personal Information: We may also collect non-personal
      information, such as device information, app usage data, and other
      anonymized data that does not identify individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      3.1. Parental Consent: We may use the parent or guardian's email address
      to obtain verifiable parental consent as required by COPPA.

      3.2. Internal Use: We may use the collected information for internal
      purposes such as improving our Easy Maths, providing customer support, and
      ensuring the safety and security of our users.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We may share
      personal information with trusted service providers who assist us in
      providing our services, but they are bound by strict confidentiality
      agreements and are not permitted to use the information for any other
      purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect personal
      information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
      destruction. However, no method of data transmission over the internet or
      method of electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee
      its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Parental Rights</h2>

    Parents or legal guardians have the right to review, request deletion, or
